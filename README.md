### Growth Mindset

Growth mindset is understanding that knowledge starts with learning from not only your own mistakes and successes, but also the mistakes and success of others around you. Understanding that feedback and critiques are valuable tools that allow you to improve toward your end result.

*Once you understand that the best thing about being human is that we are all fallible, our reactions to that guide our growth of understanding.*

- Know that perseverance will always be better than stagnation
- Utilize the tools around you, never be too prideful to ask for help
- ***Always challenge yourself to learn new things***
