* What is a script and how do I create one?
* How do computers fit in with the world around them?
* How do I write a script for a web page?


- Script is a guided set of instructions to achieve a desired result.
- Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
- **Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.**
    - Define the goal
    - Design the script
    - Code each step
- Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the:
    - **Vocabulary:** The words that computers understand
    - **Syntax:** How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow
- Along with learning the language itself, if you are new to programming, you will also need to learn how a computer achieves different types of goals using a **programmatic** approach to problem-solving.

- **Debugging** is just as important as the inital programming

-  You need to learn to "think" like
a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them.

- Computers solve problems **programmatically**; they follow series of instructions, one after another. The type of instructions they need are often different to the type of instructions you might give to another human. Therefore, throughout the book you will not only learn the vocabulary and syntax that JavaScript uses, but you will also learn how to write instructions that computers can follow.
