### Top 3 Most significant Learnings

- ***What makes a computer, a computer?***
    - Input
    - Storage
    - Processing
    - Output

These are the pillars of **ALL** computers.

Started as a calculator that was the size of an entire room.

- ***Binary and Data***

In binary:
- 1 = True, yes, on
- 0 = False, no, off

Combine two of them they create a **"bit"**.

Wire's carry information, 1=on, 0=off, turning the current on and off in a specifice sequence creates binary.

The more bits you combine the more complex information you can represent.

- Decimal system 
example = 1965
    - 1 = 1000
    - 9 = 900
    - 6 = 60
    - 5 = 5

Binary mutiplies by 2 per position
Example positions = 8 4 2 1 
The number 9 is written as: 1001
The number 481 is written as : 111100001
<!-- Look at your notebook for reference table -->

Text, images, and sound can all be represented by numbers.


- ***Circuts and Logic***

Circuts modify and process information that is represented in 1's and 0's

Different types of Circuts:
- NOT - Returns inverse 1's and 0's
- AND - Both inputs must be 1 to return 1, all else are 0
- NAND -
- NOR
- OR
- XOR
- ADDER

Smaller Circuts process information faster because, the smaller the circut the shorter travel distance for the signal.

Shorter travel = faster processing and output
