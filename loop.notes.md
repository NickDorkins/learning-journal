### Loop Notes

**Statements being compared: Numbers, strings, booleans.**

- **== - equal to**
    - This operator compares two values to see if they are the same.

- **!= - is not equal to**
    - This operator compares two values to see if they are not the same.

- **=== - strict equal to**
    - This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.


- **!== - strict is not equal to**
    - This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same.

- **(>) Greater than**
    - This operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.

- **(<) Less than**
    - This operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.

- **(>=) Greater than or Equal to**
    - This operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.

- **(<=) Less than or Equal to**
    - This operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.

- **Operand**
    - Placed on each side or the operator, can be variables or values. Often enclosed in brackets.    


- **(score >= pass)**
    - () = enclosing brackets
    - score/pass = operand
    - >= = comparison Operator



### Loops

Loops check condition, if value returns true, code block runs.

Code block will continue to run until the codition returns false.

**For** - Used to run code block a specific number of times.

**While** - Continue to run code block until condition returns false.

**Do While** - similar to the while loop, will run code block at least once, even if the condition returns false.
